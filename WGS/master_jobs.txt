First, doing a round of alignment and SNP calling on only the generation 70 samples to refine our reference.
This just fixes SNPs found in the founding genotypes that are not in our W303 reference. It isn't perfect and doesn't
add in the markers or anything, and also is done once for all 3 founders - a, alpha, and diploid. Anyways, the point
is just to make a new reference fasta so we end up with vcf files with fewer SNPs by getting rid of the obvious culprits.

# Runs bwa etc. on gen 70 WGS files using the original w303 reference
sbatch --array=1-90 orig_pilon_wgs_runner.sh

# combines bams from gen 70 samples, runs pilon, and tidies up to produce a new fasta and gff
sbatch combine_ref_bams_and_pilon.sh

This is after doing pilon stuff

# Fixes up the new reference for use
sbatch setup_ref.sh

# bwa, gatk, woo
sbatch --array=1-540 wgs_runner.sh

# gatk combining
sbatch --array=1-18 combine_vcfs.sh
# those jobs were an absolute nightmare to get done, some took over 2 days... maybe there is a better way...

see how_I_setup_snpEFF.txt for how that worked

sbatch annotate_vcfs.sh

#calls python final_vcf_parsing.py, combines all the separate chromosome ones, adds some annotations, filters and outputs per well
sbatch vcf_parsing.sh
python final_vcf_parsing.py
